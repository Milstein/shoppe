Sample E-Commerce App

Highlights use of custom open graph to share purchases and coupon redemptions
back to your friends.

Buying a product generates a "purchased" story. If you enter in a working
coupon code, a "redeem" coupon story is also generated.

How to install:

1) Goto https://developers.facebook.com/apps and create a new app.
2) Give your app a namespace, in this example we used "carshoppe" but it
   should be something different.
3) Create the app using the Heroku cloud service provider and select node.js
4) If you have not setup a Heroku account before, follow the instructions that
   Heroku will email you.
5) Verify that your Heroku auto-created sample app works.
6) Copy the files from this this Shoppe sample app, overwriting any files.
7) Edit web.js and replace thw two instances of "carshoppe" with the namespace
   you chose in step 2.
8) Check in your code, and push the changes to Heroku.
9) Enjoy.
